Before everythign else: build-keys -> creates/updates the signing keystore.  Do this if you're having issues with incoming packages or mirrors not being signed properly

Publishing a new branch:
- create-branch [branch]
- create-es-mirror [branch] [version] [verision++]
- update-mirror [branch] [component] -> Start with the stable component, only needs testing or unstable if we're playing with ES versions (see below)
- include-binaries [branch] [component] [changes file]
- publish-branch [branch]
- push

Oops, I broke something (ie, bad packages, added to the wrong repo)
- If you've published already
  - drop-publish [branch]
- drop-snapshots [branch] [component] [YYYY-MM-DD]
- drop-[external|oc]-package [branch] [component] [packagename] [version]
NOTE: Removing a package from *all* repos and snapshots will remove it completely from the filesystem!
NOTE: Until you push all changes are local.  Unless you're on pkg.  Don't do that.

Promote a package (ie, testing to stable)
- copy-[external|oc]-package [branch] [src component] [dest component] [package name] [version]
- If you have published or otherwise created a snapshot today
  - drop-publish [branch]
  - drop-snapshots [branch] [dest component]
- drop-[external|oc]-package [branch] [src component] [packagename] [version]
- publish-branch [branch]
- push

Updating ES versions with a pre-existing branch:
- edit-es-mirror [branch] [component] [version] [version++]
- update-mirror [branch] [component]
- publish-branch [branch]
- push
